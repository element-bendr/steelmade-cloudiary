# Modularization Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the plan to refactor the project towards a more modular architecture. The goal is to improve maintainability, scalability, and reduce the complexity of updates.

## 1. Analyze Current Structure
- **Objective:** Understand the existing codebase, identify dependencies, and pinpoint areas that will benefit most from modularization.
- **Tasks:**
    - Map out current components and their interactions.
    - Identify tightly coupled sections of the code.
    - List functionalities that can be logically grouped.

## 2. Define Module Boundaries
- **Objective:** Determine logical groupings for code based on functionality, domain, or feature.
- **Tasks:**
    - Define clear responsibilities for each proposed module.
    - Sketch out the high-level interaction between these modules.
    - Consider a layered architecture (e.g., core services, features, UI components) if applicable.

## 3. Choose a Modularization Strategy
- **Objective:** Decide on the specific approach for structuring modules.
- **Tasks:**
    - Evaluate different patterns (e.g., feature-based modules, layer-based modules).
    - Decide on a consistent directory structure for modules.
    - Establish conventions for module interfaces (e.g., clear entry points, well-defined APIs).

## 4. Refactor Incrementally
- **Objective:** Implement the modularization in phases to minimize disruption.
- **Tasks:**
    - Start with a small, well-defined, and less critical part of the application to create the first module.
    - Create a new directory for the module.
    - Move relevant files and code into the new module.
    - Update imports/exports and resolve any dependency issues.
    - Define clear interfaces for interaction between the new module and the rest of the application.
    - Ensure the public API of the module is well-documented.

## 5. Integrate Data Validation (e.g., Zod)
- **Objective:** Enhance data integrity and reliability at module boundaries.
- **Tasks:**
    - Identify data structures passed between modules or received from external sources.
    - Define Zod schemas for these data structures.
    - Implement validation using these schemas at the entry points of modules or wherever data crosses module boundaries.
    - Handle validation errors gracefully.

## 6. Test Thoroughly
- **Objective:** Ensure that refactoring does not introduce regressions and that modules function as expected.
- **Tasks:**
    - Write unit tests for individual functions/components within modules.
    - Write integration tests to verify interactions between modules.
    - Perform end-to-end testing for critical user flows affected by the refactoring.
    - Ensure existing tests pass after each refactoring step.

## 7. Document Changes
- **Objective:** Keep the project documentation up-to-date with the new architecture.
- **Tasks:**
    - Update existing architecture diagrams and documents.
    - Document the API and usage of each new module.
    - Explain any new conventions or patterns introduced.
    - Document Zod schemas and validation logic.

## 8. Repeat for Other Modules
- **Objective:** Apply the refactoring process to other parts of the codebase.
- **Tasks:**
    - Prioritize modules based on impact and complexity.
    - Follow steps 4-7 for each new module.

## 9. Review and Iterate
- **Objective:** Continuously improve the modular structure.
- **Tasks:**
    - Periodically review the module boundaries and dependencies.
    - Gather feedback from the team.
    - Make adjustments to the modular structure as the project evolves and new requirements emerge.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **TypeScript:** For strong typing and better code organization.
- **Zod (Optional but Recommended):** For runtime data validation, especially at module boundaries.
- **Testing Frameworks (e.g., Jest, Vitest):** For unit and integration testing.

This plan will serve as a guide for the refactoring effort. It should be treated as a living document and updated as needed.
