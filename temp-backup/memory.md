## Codebase Analysis and Setup Status (5/12/2025)

**Project Status Assessment:**
- Project appears to be in initial configuration-only phase
- Only tsconfig.json is present with proper Next.js configuration
- Missing Next.js app directory structure and core components
- Documentation (PRD, rules, planner) is comprehensive but no implementation exists yet

**Key Implementation Gaps:**
- No evidence of Next.js initialization via `create-next-app`
- Missing Shadcn UI setup and component installation
- No implementation of required TypeScript interfaces for data models
- No component directory structure established
- Missing core layout components (Header, Footer)
- No pages implemented (Homepage, About, Products, etc.)

**Potential Duplication Risks:**
- Without centralized component library, UI elements might be duplicated across pages
- Missing clear TypeScript interfaces could lead to inconsistent data handling
- Lack of CSS/styling organization could result in redundant style definitions
- Multiple product display components might be created without proper abstraction

**Technical Debt Concerns:**
- Project requires strict optimization per rules.md (runtime and memory efficiency)
- Missing proper image optimization strategy from the beginning
- No established pattern for component reuse across similar sections (e.g., Cards)

These observations will guide the implementation plan to ensure code reuse, prevent duplication, and maintain the high standards outlined in the rules.md document.

## Implementation Strategy Analysis (5/12/2025)

**Phased Implementation Approach:**

1. **Foundation Phase:**
   - Initialize Next.js project following PRD specifications
   - Set up Shadcn UI with custom theming for the red accent (#B91C1C)
   - Establish TypeScript interface definitions for core data models
   - Create component organization strategy to prevent duplication

2. **Core Structure Implementation:**
   - Define reusable layout components (Header, Footer, Container)
   - Implement standardized page templates with proper SEO metadata
   - Create shared UI component library with documentation
   - Establish image optimization pipeline with Next.js Image

3. **Anti-Duplication Strategies:**
   - Create central component registry documenting all UI components
   - Implement strict typing for all data structures
   - Design card component system with composition pattern for reuse across sections

└── tsconfig.json            # TypeScript configuration
```

### Anti-Duplication Strategies:

1. **Centralized Metadata Handling:**
   ```typescript
   // lib/metadata.ts
   export function generateMetadata({ 
     title, 
     description, 
     path,
     image,
     type = 'website'
   }: MetadataParams) {
     const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || 'https://steelmade.com';
     
     return {
       title: `${title} | SteelMade Furniture`,
       description,
       canonical: `${baseUrl}${path}`,
       openGraph: {
         title,
         description,
         url: `${baseUrl}${path}`,
         images: [{ url: image || `${baseUrl}/images/default-og.webp` }],
         type
       },
       // Additional metadata properties
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Shared Layout Components:**
   - Create a single `components/layout/header.tsx` to be used throughout the site
   - Implement one `components/layout/footer.tsx` for consistent footers
   - Use shared `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx` in the app directory

3. **Component Composition Pattern:**
   - Create base components that can be extended for specific use cases
   - Use composition over inheritance for UI components
   - Implement props for customization rather than creating similar components

4. **Centralized Theme Provider:**
   - Single theme provider implementation in `components/theme-provider.tsx`
   - Consistent color scheme variables in Tailwind configuration

This structure will prevent the duplication issues identified in the analysis while maintaining a clean, organized codebase with proper separation of concerns.

## Anti-Duplication Implementation Guidelines (5/12/2025)

**To address the duplication concerns identified in the codebase analysis, the following implementation guidelines should be followed:**

1. **Standardize Configuration Files:**
   - Use only one Next.js configuration file (next.config.js)
   - Ensure all image optimization settings are consolidated
   - Keep typescript configurations in tsconfig.json

2. **Create Centralized Component Library:**
   - Implement a shared UI component system following Atomic Design principles
   - Create proper component documentation with usage examples
   - Set up component reuse tracking to identify duplication opportunities

3. **Implement Shared Layout Structure:**
   - Create a consistent layout hierarchy with proper composition
   - Use context providers for theme, navigation state, and cart functionality
   - Ensure layout components have clear responsibilities

4. **Standardize Data Fetching Patterns:**
   - Create unified data fetching utilities for all product and collection data
   - Implement proper caching and revalidation strategies
   - Use React Query or SWR for client-side data fetching consistency

5. **Develop Shared Error Handling System:**
   - Create reusable error boundary components
   - Implement standardized error UI components with consistent styling
   - Develop a unified error logging and reporting system

6. **Consolidate Metadata Generation:**
   - Use a single metadata generation utility for all pages
   - Ensure consistent SEO attributes across all pages
   - Implement proper canonical URL handling

7. **Create Component Variant System:**
   - Use a variant pattern for UI components that need different visual states
   - Implement proper prop typing for all component variations
   - Create a visual documentation system for component variants

These guidelines will help prevent duplication in the codebase and ensure that the project maintains high standards of code quality and organization throughout implementation.

---

## Duplication Prevention Strategy (5/13/2025)

**To address specific duplication risks identified in the codebase analysis:**

1. **Header and Footer Standardization:**
   - Implement a single `HeaderComponent` with configurable options for different pages
   - Create one `FooterComponent` with modular sections that can be toggled
   - Use a shared navigation data structure to maintain consistency:

   ```typescript
   // types/navigation.ts
   export interface NavigationItem {
     title: string;
     href: string;
     children?: NavigationItem[];
     isExternal?: boolean;
   }
   
   // data/navigation.ts
   export const mainNavigation: NavigationItem[] = [
     { title: 'Home', href: '/' },
     { 
       title: 'Collections', 
       href: '/collections',
       children: [
         { title: 'Chairs', href: '/collections/chairs' },
         { title: 'Tables', href: '/collections/tables' },
         { title: 'Storage', href: '/collections/storage' }
       ]
     },
     // Additional navigation items
   ];
   ```

2. **Product/Collection Page Structure:**
   - Create a reusable page template for all collection pages:

   ```typescript
   // app/(shop)/collections/[collectionSlug]/page.tsx
   export default async function CollectionPage({ 
     params 
   }: { 
     params: { collectionSlug: string } 
   }) {
     const collection = await getCollectionBySlug(params.collectionSlug);
     
     return (
       <CollectionTemplate
         collection={collection}
         products={collection.products}
         filters={getFiltersForCollection(params.collectionSlug)}
       />
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Error, Loading, and Not-Found Components:**
   - Implement shared components with customization options:

   ```typescript
   // components/ui/error-boundary.tsx
   export function ErrorBoundary({
     title = 'Something went wrong',
     message = 'Please try again later',
     retry,
     customImage
   }: ErrorBoundaryProps) {
     // Implementation with customization options
   }
   ```

4. **Metadata Generation:**
   - Implement a single utility for all metadata needs:

   ```typescript
   // lib/metadata.ts
   export function generateMetadata({
     title,
     description,
     path,
     type = 'website',
     collection,
     product
   }: MetadataParams) {
     // Base metadata implementation
     const baseMetadata = {
       // Common metadata fields
     };
     
     // Conditional metadata based on context
     if (product) {
       // Add product-specific metadata
     } else if (collection) {
       // Add collection-specific metadata
     }
     
     return baseMetadata;
   }
   ```

5. **Component Organization:**
   - Group components by domain and functionality
   - Create index files to simplify imports and encourage reuse:

   ```typescript
   // components/products/index.ts
   export * from './product-card';
   export * from './product-grid';
   export * from './product-filters';
   ```

By implementing these specific strategies, we can prevent duplication across similar pages and components while maintaining flexibility for different content needs.

## Initial Project Setup Plan (5/13/2025)

**Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:**

1. **Initialize Next.js Project:**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest steelmadewebsite --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir
   ```

2. **Install Core Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install @radix-ui/react-slot class-variance-authority clsx tailwindcss-animate
   npm install sharp # For image optimization
   npm install lucide-react # For icons
   ```

3. **Configure Shadcn UI:**
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init
   ```
   
   - Configure with:
     - TypeScript: Yes
     - Style: Default (minimal)
     - Base color: Slate
     - CSS variables: Yes
     - Global CSS: src/app/globals.css
     - React Server Components: Yes
     - Components directory: src/components
     - Utilities directory: src/lib/utils

4. **Standardize Configuration:**
   - Create a single next.config.js with all necessary settings
   - Implement comprehensive image optimization settings
   - Set up proper module path aliases in tsconfig.json

5. **Create Core Type Definitions:**
   - Implement Product, Collection, and other data model interfaces
   - Create utility types for component props
   - Establish shared type declarations for API responses

6. **Set Up Core Layout Components:**
   - Create a single header component with responsive design
   - Implement a standard footer component
   - Develop a root layout with proper metadata

7. **Implement Centralized Metadata Handling:**
   - Create a metadata utility for consistent SEO across all pages
   - Implement proper canonical URL handling
   - Set up default Open Graph images and descriptions

This phased approach ensures that the foundation is solid before implementing specific features, preventing duplication and inconsistency as the project grows.

- The navigation mega menu dropdowns are now aligned based on their position:

  - The first item ("Modular Furniture") aligns its dropdown to the left (`left-0`).
  - The last item ("Company") aligns its dropdown to the right (`right-0`).
  - All other items remain centered (`left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`).

- This prevents dropdown overflow and disappearing issues at the edges.

- The subcategory text color issue was fixed by using `text-foreground` instead of `accent-foreground` on hover/focus.

## URL Structure Refactoring and Link Standardization (5/19/2025)

**Objective:** Overhaul the website's URL structure for product categories, series, and individual products to be more SEO-friendly, user-readable, and consistent. Transition from prefixed paths (e.g., `/products/...`, `/collections/...`) to top-level paths (e.g., `/[categorySlug]`, `/[categorySlug]/[seriesSlug]`).

**Key Changes and Accomplishments:**

1.  **Reusable Category Page Layout:**
    *   All product category pages (`chairs`, `desks`, `storage`, `school-furniture`, `hospital-furniture`, `racking-systems`, `storage-solutions`) were refactored to use a common reusable layout component: `e:\steelmadewebsite\components\products\ProductCategoryPageLayout.tsx`.
    *   This involved updating each page to fetch its specific data (series, products) and pass it as props to the layout component.

2.  **Data Fetching and Types:**
    *   Added `getSeriesForCategory` function to `e:\steelmadewebsite\lib\api\products.ts` to streamline data retrieval for category pages.
    *   Updated `ProductCategory` type in `e:\steelmadewebsite\types\collections.ts` to include all relevant categories and standardized slugs to use hyphens (e.g., `school-furniture` instead of `schoolFurniture`).
    *   Modified mock data in `e:\steelmadewebsite\lib\data\mock-data.ts` (`MOCK_SERIES`, `MOCK_PRODUCTS`) to align with new/updated categories and ensure data consistency for development and testing.
    *   Resolved various type errors, notably for `SeriesMetadata.coverImage` (mismatch between `ImageAsset` and `string`) and schema import issues in `ProductCategoryPageLayout.tsx` (e.g., `WebsiteSchema` vs. `OrganizationSchema`). This involved updates in `SeriesCardStatic.tsx`, `SeriesGrid.tsx`, and `SeriesCardInteractive.tsx` to correctly import and use types like `SeriesMetadata` and `ImageAsset`.

3.  **URL Generation Logic (`lib/navigation.ts`):**
    *   Updated `productCategories` object to use the new hyphenated slugs.
    *   Modified `getCategoryUrl` to generate links like `/[categorySlug]` for category pages and `/[categorySlug]/[seriesSlug]` for series pages, removing any `/products/` or `/collections/` prefixes.
    *   Modified `getProductUrl` to generate links like `/[categorySlug]/[seriesSlug]/[productSlug]`, ensuring consistency with the new top-level URL strategy. The function signature was updated to include `seriesId`.

4.  **Next.js Redirects (`next.config.js`):**
    *   Reviewed and updated existing redirects.
    *   Commented out/removed redirects that would force top-level paths (e.g., `/:category/:seriesId`) back to prefixed paths (e.g., `/products/:category/:seriesId`).
    *   Updated redirects for old `/collections/...` paths to point to the new top-level `/:category/:seriesId` paths.
    *   Added new redirects to ensure old `/products/:category/:seriesId/:productId` paths correctly forward to the new `/:category/:seriesId/:productId` structure, preserving link equity and user experience.

5.  **Navigation Component Updates:**
    *   **`CategoryNav.tsx` (`components/collections/CategoryNav.tsx`):** Updated `href` attributes for category links to use the new top-level format (e.g., `/${categorySlug}`).
    *   **Mega Menu (`lib/data/navigation.ts`):** Systematically updated all `href` values within the `mainNavigation` array. Ensured top-level category links are `/[categorySlug]` and series/sub-category links are absolute paths like `/[categorySlug]/[seriesSlug]`, removing all `/products/` prefixes.
    *   **Footer Links (`components/ui/footer.tsx`):** Updated product category links in the site footer to use the new top-level paths (e.g., `/chairs`, `/desks`). Removed the "View All" link as per request.

**Outcome:**
The website now employs a consistent, hierarchical, and SEO-friendly URL structure across all product-related pages. This improves clarity for users and search engines, simplifies navigation logic, and aligns with modern web best practices. All internal links generated by navigation components and utility functions now adhere to this new structure. Redirects are in place to handle old URL formats gracefully. Ongoing testing is planned to ensure full site functionality and link integrity.

## "Modular Furniture" Category Implementation (5/20/2025)

**Objective:** Add a new "modular-furniture" category to the website, including type definitions, mock data, page routes, and initial page component setup.

**Key Changes and Accomplishments:**

1.  **Type Definitions (`types/collections.ts`, `types/products.ts`):**
    *   Added "modular-furniture" to `ProductCategoryKey`, `ProductCategorySlug`, and `ProductCategory` types.
    *   Updated `CategoryCollections` to include "modular-furniture".
    *   Added "modular-furniture" to `ProductType` and "Modular Furniture" to `ProductCategory` in product types.

2.  **Mock Data (`lib/data/mock-data.ts`):**
    *   Added "modular-furniture" to `MOCK_SERIES` with initial series: "office-modules" (originally "office-workstations", updated to fix a 404) and "reception-counters".
    *   Added corresponding products to `MOCK_PRODUCTS` under these series.
    *   Updated series ID from "office-workstations" to "office-modules" in `MOCK_SERIES` and `MOCK_PRODUCTS` to align with navigation data and resolve a 404 error for `/modular-furniture/office-modules`.

3.  **Page Creation (`app/modular-furniture/...`):**
    *   Created `page.tsx` for the main category page (`/modular-furniture`).
    *   Created `[seriesId]/page.tsx` for series-specific pages (e.g., `/modular-furniture/office-modules`).
    *   Created `[seriesId]/[productId]/page.tsx` for individual product detail pages.

4.  **Service Enhancements (`lib/services/product-service.ts`):**
    *   Added `getCategoryData` function to fetch category-specific details.
    *   Added `getAllProductsInCategory` function.
    *   Updated `getProductDetails` function to support the new category.

5.  **Product Detail Page Component (`app/modular-furniture/[seriesId]/[productId]/page.tsx`):
    *   Resolved `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/products/ProductDetailsPage'` error by changing the import to use the existing `ProductPageLayout` component (`@/components/products/ProductPageLayout`).
    *   Corrected associated type errors in the product page component:
        *   Updated metadata generation to use `product.name` and `product.description` (from `ProductData` type).
        *   Changed `openGraph.type` from "product" to "article" (a valid `OpenGraphType`).
        *   Provided a more complete `MOCK_SERIES_DATA` object aligning with `SeriesMetadata` type for the `ProductPageLayout`, including placeholder image `width` and `height`, and correct type assertions for `ProductCategory`.
        *   Added necessary imports for `SeriesMetadata`, `ProductCategory`, and `ProductData` types.

6.  **Navigation (`lib/data/navigation.ts`):**
    *   Confirmed "Modular Furniture" entry with `href: "/modular-furniture"` already existed.
    *   Mega menu links like `/modular-furniture/office-modules` were a key part of identifying the series ID mismatch.

**Outcome:**
The foundational elements for the "modular-furniture" category are now in place, including type definitions, mock data, page routes, and basic page components. A critical 404 error and a module not found error have been resolved. Further testing and refinement are required.
