## Recently Completed Tasks

### Utility Function Enhancements (Date: Current)

- ✅ Resolved ProductSeriesPage component error showing in cterror.md
- ✅ Fixed Schema.org metadata category formatting

### Collections System Enhancement (Date: Previous Sprint)

- ✅ Added error handling and custom error types

- When adding or reordering navigation items, ensure the dropdown alignment logic is preserved:

  - First item: `left-0`
  - Last item: `right-0`
  - Others: centered

- If new edge cases arise (e.g., more than two edge items), extend the conditional logic accordingly.

- If the theme or color palette changes, verify that `text-foreground` remains readable on all backgrounds.

- If you add more navigation items, check for overflow and adjust dropdown widths as needed.
