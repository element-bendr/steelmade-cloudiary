# Progress Tracker

## Recently Completed Tasks

### Utility Function Enhancements (Date: Current)
- ✅ Added `capitalize` utility function to fix build errors
- ✅ Resolved ProductSeriesPage component error showing in cterror.md
- ✅ Fixed Schema.org metadata category formatting
- ✅ Updated memory.md and planner.md with recent changes

### Collections System Enhancement (Date: Previous Sprint)
- ✅ Implemented type-safe collections data model
- ✅ Separated data layer from business logic
- ✅ Added error handling and custom error types
- ✅ Implemented caching for computed filters
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in lib/README.md
- When adding or reordering navigation items, ensure the dropdown alignment logic is preserved:

  - First item: `left-0`
  - Last item: `right-0`
  - Others: centered

- If new edge cases arise (e.g., more than two edge items), extend the conditional logic accordingly.

- If the theme or color palette changes, verify that `text-foreground` remains readable on all backgrounds.

- If you add more navigation items, check for overflow and adjust dropdown widths as needed.
