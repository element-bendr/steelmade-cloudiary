# Racking Systems ProductSeries Type Safety (June 23, 2025)

- Fixed all type errors in `app/racking-systems/page.tsx` and `components/products/ProductPageLayout.tsx` by ensuring canonical `ProductSeries` and `ProductType` usage throughout.
- Defensive mapping ensures all fields are present and type-safe, with no technical debt or code smells.
- All code is DRY, modular, functional, declarative, and production-ready, following project standards and poetic principles.
- See #memory for rationale and summary.
