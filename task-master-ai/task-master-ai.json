This causes type errors when calling API functions that expect a valid ProductCategorySlug.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Update the ProductCategorySlug type in types/product-categories.ts and types/product-categories-unified.ts to include all specialized furniture categories\n2. Add appropriate display name mappings for the new categories\n3. Update category lists in components where all categories are enumerated\n4. Ensure all imports use the updated type definitions\n5. Update tests to include the new categories\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- No type errors in the specialized furniture category routes\n- Consistent usage of the new categories across the application\n- All components and pages that handle product categories work correctly with the new categories\n- Documentation updated to reflect the additions",

Update product detail pages to use this component\n2. Ensure the variant selection state is properly passed to this component\n3. Connect the contact form to include the selected variant information"
