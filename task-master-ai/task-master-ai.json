Update product detail pages to use this component\n2. Ensure the variant selection state is properly passed to this component\n3. Connect the contact form to include the selected variant information"

      "content": "## Image Loading Issue Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the chair image loading problem revealed several issues:\n\n1. **Missing Default Variant Selection:**\n   - No variant is selected by default when the page loads\n   - The image container relies on a selected variant to display an image\n   - The fallback mechanism isn't properly implemented\n\n2. **Inconsistent Image Path Construction:**\n   - Different chair pages use slightly different methods to construct image paths\n   - Some paths use relative URLs instead of absolute Cloudinary URLs\n   - Error handling for missing images isn't consistent\n\n3. **Visual Inconsistencies:**\n   - The Tycoon chair page has a different features list layout\n   - Variant button text color isn't using the brand red color\n   - The image container lacks visual elements like the requested corner rectangle\n\n## Solution Approach:\n\n1. **Fix Default Variant Selection:**\n   - Implemented useEffect hook to select the first variant on component mount\n   - Added proper fallback to product.images[0] when no variant is selected\n   - Ensured consistent image path construction across all chair models\n\n2. **Enhance Visual Presentation:**\n   - Added decorative rectangle in the top-right corner of the image box\n   - Updated variant button text to use brand red color (#B91C1C)\n   - Standardized features list layout across all chair models\n   - Added subtle animations for variant selection\n\n3. **Improve Error Handling:**\n   - Added onError handler for images to fall back to a default image\n   - Implemented loading state while images are being fetched\n   - Added consistent error logging for debugging\n\nThese changes ensure that all chair detail pages display an image immediately on load, have consistent styling, and provide a better user experience."
