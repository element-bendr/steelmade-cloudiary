      "category": "Code Quality",
      "details": "We've successfully standardized the product type system across the application by creating a centralized type system in `types/product-categories.ts` and `types/variants.ts`. The implementation provides a single source of truth for product categories, with clear distinctions between URL-friendly slugs (ProductCategorySlug) and display names (ProductCategoryName). We've added type guards for runtime validation and helper functions for conversion between formats. This has eliminated the inconsistencies between ProductType and ProductCategory that were causing type errors throughout the codebase.",

This highlights a common problem when standardizing types across an existing codebase: there are often multiple, incompatible type definitions for the same concept. Our short-term solution was to use type assertions (as unknown as ProductCategorySlug) to work around the issue, but a more comprehensive fix will require updating the SeriesMetadata interface to properly use our standardized types.

Instead of relying on temporary type assertions, we created a standardized type system in product-categories-unified.ts that serves as the single source of truth for all product category related types. We updated the API functions to use this standardized type system and added proper validation to ensure type safety at both compile time and runtime.
