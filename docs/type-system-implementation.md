# Type System Standardization

## Phase 1: Initial Implementation (Task 7)

We've successfully standardized the product category and variant type systems by:

1. Creating centralized type definitions:
   - `types/product-categories.ts` - Unified product category types
   - `types/variants.ts` - Standardized variant interface

2. Implementing helper functions:
   - Category conversions between slugs and display names
   - Type guards for runtime validation
   - Adapter functions for variant compatibility

3. Updating key components:
   - Collection components now use the standard types
   - API functions have been updated for type safety
   - Contact button component handles both variant formats

4. Adding comprehensive documentation:
   - Created `type-system.md` with usage examples
   - Added migration guide for future development

## Phase 2: Complete Implementation (Task 8)

The next phase focuses on:

1. Completing the rollout across all components
2. Removing temporary adapter functions
3. Ensuring consistent type usage throughout the codebase
4. Verifying build success with no type errors
5. Testing all product pages to ensure functionality

## Implementation Strategy

Our approach to standardizing the type system follows these principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All type definitions centralized in dedicated files
2. **Type Safety**: Using TypeScript's type system to catch errors at compile time
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Supporting existing code during the transition
4. **Clear Documentation**: Providing examples and guidelines for developers
5. **Progressive Implementation**: Updating components in stages to avoid breaking changes

## Current Status

- Core type definitions are complete
- Key API functions have been updated
- Main collection components now use standardized types
- Variant compatibility layer implemented
- Documentation created

## Next Steps

- Update product detail pages
- Update navigation components
- Update remaining API functions
- Remove all temporary adapter functions
- Comprehensive testing
