# Resolving Duplicate Function Issue in Director Series

## Problem Statement

The Director Series implementation currently has a duplicate function definition for `registerDirectorChair` in the index.ts file, which is causing TypeScript errors and preventing the application from building correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Circular Dependencies**: The current implementation may have circular dependencies where chair files import from index.ts, which in turn imports chair files.

2. **Multiple Function Declarations**: The index.ts file appears to have multiple declarations of the same function.

3. **Import Order Issues**: The order of imports and function declarations may be causing TypeScript to interpret duplicated declarations.

## Solution Strategy

### Approach 1: Complete Replacement

1. Create a completely new index.ts file with clean, single function definitions
2. Replace the existing file with the new implementation
3. Update all chair files to use the new index.ts exports

### Approach 2: Split Registration Logic

1. Create a separate registry.ts file that handles chair registration
2. Move the registration logic out of index.ts
3. Update chair files to import registration functions from registry.ts
4. Use index.ts only for exports

### Approach 3: Refactor Import Structure

1. Reorder imports and declarations in index.ts
2. Ensure all function declarations come before imports
3. Remove any duplicate code
4. Add explicit typing to all functions

## Selected Solution: Approach 1

We will implement Approach 1 as it provides the cleanest solution with minimal risk:

1. Create a new index-fixed.ts file with clean implementations
2. Verify it works correctly
3. Replace the original index.ts file
4. Update all dependent files if needed

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Clean Implementation**:
   - Create index-fixed.ts with single definitions of all functions
   - Ensure proper typing and error handling
   - Add clear documentation

2. **Test New Implementation**:
   - Import from index-fixed.ts in a test file
   - Verify chair registration works
   - Check for any TypeScript errors

3. **Replace Original File**:
   - Backup the original index.ts
   - Replace with the new implementation
   - Update any imports if needed

4. **Verify Application**:
   - Build the application
   - Test chair page rendering
   - Confirm no TypeScript errors

## Long-term Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Add clear documentation about the proper import patterns
2. Implement a linting rule to detect duplicate function declarations
3. Create a standardized template for product registration
4. Add unit tests for the registry functionality
