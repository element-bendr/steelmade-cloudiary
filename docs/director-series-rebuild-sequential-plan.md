# Director Series Rebuild - Sequential Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Cataloging and Documentation

1. **Document All Chair Models**
   - Review each existing chair in the director series
   - Create a spreadsheet or document listing:
     - Chair name, description, and category
     - All variants and their names
     - All features for each chair
     - All image URLs currently in use
     - Any special customizations or unique features

2. **Analyze Current Structure**
   - Examine the current file structure for chair data and pages
   - Document the import patterns and component usage
   - Identify inconsistencies in data structure and styling
   - Note different approaches to handling variants and images

3. **Create Backup**
   - Create a backup branch of the current implementation
   - Document the current routing structure
   - Save examples of current implementations for reference

## Step 2: Remove Existing Implementation

1. **Remove Chair Data Files**
   - Delete all individual chair data files from lib/data/products/chairs/director-series
   - Remove exports from the index file but keep the file structure
   - Document the removal process for potential rollback

2. **Remove Chair Pages**
   - Remove all individual chair detail page components
   - Clear chair listings from the director series overview page
   - Keep the page structure intact for reimplementation

3. **Cleanup Related Code**
   - Remove any chair-specific imports or references
   - Clean up any unused components or utilities
   - Verify all chair-related code is removed

## Step 3: Implement Core Infrastructure

1. **Create Chair Interface**
   - Define a standardized Chair interface with proper typing
   - Include required and optional fields
   - Document the interface properties and usage

2. **Implement Chair Factory**
   - Create createDirectorChair factory function
   - Implement validation for required fields
   - Add utility functions for data transformation
   - Create Cloudinary URL generator utility

3. **Build Component Library**
   - Create/update ChairVariantSelector component
   - Implement ChairImageDisplay with consistent styling
   - Build ChairFeatureList with grid layout
   - Develop ChairContactButton with variant display

4. **Create Page Templates**
   - Build standardized chair detail page template
   - Create consistent director series grid component
   - Implement proper loading and error states
   - Add accessibility features

## Step 4: Reimplementing Chairs

For each chair, follow this consistent process:

1. **Chair Data Creation**
   - Use factory function to create chair data
   - Configure variants and features
   - Set up proper Cloudinary image URLs
   - Add to the director series index

2. **Detail Page Implementation**
   - Create page component using standardized template
   - Connect with chair data
   - Implement proper routing
   - Add chair-specific customizations if needed

3. **Grid Display Addition**
   - Add chair to director series overview grid
   - Implement consistent card styling
   - Add proper image and information display
   - Ensure consistent hover effects and animations

4. **Testing**
   - Test the chair detail page for proper rendering
   - Verify variant selection functionality
   - Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Ensure consistent styling with other chairs

## Step 5: Implementation Order

Implement chairs in this specific order:

1. **Ashley Director Chair** (as the reference implementation)
   - Establish the pattern for other chairs
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Set styling standards

2. **Opera Director Chair**
   - Follow the pattern established by Ashley chair
   - Verify consistency with the reference implementation

3. **Tycoon Director Chair**
   - Ensure feature list is displayed consistently
   - Match styling with previous implementations

4. **BigBoss Gold Director Chair**
   - Maintain consistent styling
   - Verify variant handling

5. **Woodland Director Chair**
   - Address previous product not found errors
   - Ensure proper image URL configuration

6. **Boston Director Chair**
   - Implement using the new factory pattern
   - Verify consistency with other chairs

## Step 6: Finalization

1. **Director Series Overview Page**
   - Implement consistent grid for all chairs
   - Apply standardized card styling
   - Add proper animations and hover effects
   - Ensure responsive behavior

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Review all chair pages for visual consistency
   - Test functionality across all chairs
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Check accessibility compliance

3. **Documentation Update**
   - Document the new implementation
   - Create guide for adding future chairs
   - Update architecture documentation
   - Add troubleshooting section

## Success Criteria

The rebuild will be considered successful when:

1. All chairs have consistent styling across all pages
2. All chair data follows the standardized structure
3. All components use the unified styling system
4. Adding new chairs is simplified through the factory pattern
5. All pages are responsive and accessible
6. Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

This sequential approach ensures methodical implementation and consistent results across all chair products.
