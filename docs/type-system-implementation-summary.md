# Type System Standardization Implementation

## Summary

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to standardize the product type system across the application, eliminating inconsistencies between `ProductType` and `ProductCategory`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Centralized Type Definitions

We've created centralized type definition files:

- `product-categories-unified.ts`: Single source of truth for product categories
- `product-variants-unified.ts`: Standardized variant interface and adapters

### 2. API Layer Updates

The API layer has been updated to use the standardized types:

- `collections-unified.ts`: Uses `ProductCategorySlug` for all operations
- `products-unified.ts`: Uses unified types with improved error handling

### 3. Component Updates

We've created new standardized components:

- `product-card.tsx`: Unified product card component
- `variant-selector.tsx`: Type-safe variant selection
- `contact-button.tsx`: Compatible with both legacy and new variant formats

### 4. Backward Compatibility

For backward compatibility, we've implemented:

- Type aliases (`ProductType` â†’ `ProductCategorySlug`)
- Adapter functions for converting between formats
- Type guards for runtime validation

### 5. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:

- Type system overview and usage guide
- Migration instructions for updating components
- Examples of using the unified type system

## Migration Strategy

The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. Create centralized type definitions (complete)
2. Update API layer to use standardized types (complete)
3. Create new components using unified types (complete)
4. Gradually update existing components to use unified types (in progress)
5. Remove legacy adapter functions once migration is complete (pending)

## Testing

Testing should verify:

- Type safety is maintained throughout the codebase
- Components correctly display product information
- API functions return correctly typed data
- Both new and existing components work correctly

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating existing components to use unified types
2. Complete the rollout to all product pages
3. Remove temporary adapter functions
4. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
