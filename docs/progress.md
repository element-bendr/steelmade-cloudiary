# Progress Tracker

## Recently Completed Tasks

### Modular Product Catalog Implementation (Date: 6/5/2025)
- ✅ Created a modular data structure for product catalog
- ✅ Extracted shared types into product-types.ts
- ✅ Moved helper functions to product-helpers.ts
- ✅ Organized products by category and series in separate files
- ✅ Implemented backward compatibility in product-catalog.ts
- ✅ Added proper type safety across all product data
- ✅ Created index files for clean exports and imports

### Utility Function Enhancements (Date: 6/2/2025)
- ✅ Added `capitalize` utility function to fix build errors
- ✅ Resolved ProductSeriesPage component error showing in cterror.md
- ✅ Fixed Schema.org metadata category formatting
- ✅ Updated memory.md and planner.md with recent changes

### Collections System Enhancement (Date: Previous Sprint)
- ✅ Implemented type-safe collections data model
- ✅ Separated data layer from business logic
- ✅ Added error handling and custom error types
- ✅ Implemented caching for computed filters
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in lib/README.md
- When adding or reordering navigation items, ensure the dropdown alignment logic is preserved:

  - First item: `left-0`
  - Last item: `right-0`
  - Others: centered

- If new edge cases arise (e.g., more than two edge items), extend the conditional logic accordingly.

- If the theme or color palette changes, verify that `text-foreground` remains readable on all backgrounds.

- If you add more navigation items, check for overflow and adjust dropdown widths as needed.

## In Progress
- 🔄 Optimizing product data retrieval performance
- 🔄 Planning additional utility functions for string formatting
- 🔄 Adding additional product categories and series to modular structure

## Upcoming
- ⏳ API Integration for dynamic data
- ⏳ Unit tests for CollectionsService and utility functions
- ⏳ Cache persistence implementation
- ⏳ Event system for collection updates
- ⏳ Additional error recovery strategies
- ⏳ Integration with Cloudinary for product images

## Known Issues
- ⚠️ Fixed: "capitalize is not exported from '@/lib/utils'" error in ProductSeriesPage
- ⚠️ Some placeholder image URLs still using 404 paths (shown in cterror.md)
