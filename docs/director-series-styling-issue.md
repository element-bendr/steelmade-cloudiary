# Director Series Chair Page Styling Issue Analysis

## Problem Identification

I've analyzed the director series chair pages and identified several inconsistencies that cause the Tycoon Director Chair page to display differently from the Ashley and Opera chair pages:

1. **Features List Layout Inconsistency**:
   - The Tycoon chair page displays features in a vertical list
   - The Ashley and Opera chair pages display features in a horizontal grid layout
   - This is likely caused by different CSS grid classes being applied to the features list container

2. **Inconsistent Component Usage**:
   - Ashley and Opera chair pages are using the `EnhancedProductDetailLayout` component
   - The Tycoon chair page might be using a different component or direct implementation
   - This leads to visual inconsistencies across the product line

3. **CSS Class Differences**:
   - Grid classes for features layout differ: vertical list vs. grid layout
   - Spacing and padding values might be inconsistent
   - Color scheme application might vary slightly

4. **Data Structure Variations**:
   - The way features are structured in the data might differ between products
   - Some products might have features as plain arrays while others have them as objects with additional properties

## Root Cause

The primary issue appears to be the inconsistent use of components across product pages:

1. Some pages use individual implementations while others use a shared component
2. The `EnhancedProductDetailLayout` component is not consistently applied across all chair pages
3. The dynamic import paths for ProductService might be different between implementations
4. The styling for the features list is not standardized across all chair detail pages

## Solution Strategy

To create a consistent look across all director series chair pages:

1. **Standardize Component Usage**:
   - Ensure all product pages use the same `EnhancedProductDetailLayout` component
   - Consolidate any duplicate layout code into the shared component

2. **Fix Grid Layout for Features**:
   - Update the feature list container to use consistent grid classes
   - Use `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4` for consistent feature layouts

3. **Normalize Data Structure**:
   - Ensure consistent data structure for features across all products
   - Standardize the import path for ProductService

4. **Apply Brand Style Guide**:
   - Apply consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
   - Ensure proper responsive behavior across all product pages

This analysis has been documented to assist in fixing the inconsistent presentation of the director series chair pages.
