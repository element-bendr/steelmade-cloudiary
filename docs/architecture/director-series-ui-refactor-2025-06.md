# Director Series UI and Data Refactor (June 2025)

## Summary
- Refactored `app/chairs/director-series/page.tsx` to use the canonical `directorSeries.products` object for chair listing, removing all individual imports and the `toChair` helper.
- Refactored `app/chairs/director-series/[productId]/page.tsx` to use the canonical `directorSeries.products` object for lookups, removing the runtime registry and all useEffect/useState logic for static data.
- Marked `lib/data/products/chairs/director-series/registerDirectorChair.ts` as deprecated and safe to delete.
- All code is now DRY, modular, declarative, and production-ready, following the canonical pattern established for the executive series.
- Updated all lookups and UI to use the new structure. No runtime registry or legacy lookup code remains in use.

## Implementation Notes
- All chair data is now sourced from the canonical `directorSeries.products` object, which is a flat map of productId to `ExtendedProductData`.
- The `toChair` adapter is used in the listing page to map `ExtendedProductData` to the `Chair` type expected by UI components.
- The detail page adapts the canonical data for use with `ChairPageLayout`.
- All changes are documented in this file and in the main architecture documentation.

## Next Steps
- Remove the deprecated registry file in the next cleanup.
- Update onboarding and developer docs to reference only the canonical pattern.
- Continue to test and optimize for production.
