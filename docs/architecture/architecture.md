# Director Series Canonical Refactor (2025-06-28)

## Summary
- All Director Series chair data and UI now use the canonical `directorSeries.products` object.
- Legacy runtime registry and duplicate files are deprecated and safe to delete.
- UI pages are DRY, modular, and declarative, using the canonical object for all lookups and rendering.
- Documentation and onboarding have been updated to reference only the canonical pattern.

## Implementation Principles
- Functional, declarative, and poetic TypeScript
- DRY, modular, and production-ready code
- No technical debt, no code smells, no anti-patterns
- Easy to extend, maintain, and debug
