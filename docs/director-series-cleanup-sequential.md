# Director Series Cleanup - Sequential Implementation

This document outlines the step-by-step process to clean up the Director Series implementation.

## Phase 1: Preparation

### Step 1: Create Backup Branch
```bash
git checkout -b backup/director-series-cleanup
git add .
git commit -m "Create backup before director series cleanup"
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Verify Current Implementation
- Run the application to ensure it's currently working
- Document any existing issues for reference

## Phase 2: Fix Index File

### Step 1: Replace the Problematic Index File
- Rename `index-new.ts` to `index.ts` (after backing up the original)
- Ensure it has only one definition of each function
- Test the application to verify the error is resolved

### Step 2: Update Chair Data Files
- Check all chair data files to ensure they correctly import from the index file
- Fix any import or reference issues

## Phase 3: Clean Up Chair Pages

### Step 1: Update Director Series Main Page
- Rename `page-new.tsx` to `page.tsx` (after backing up the original)
- Verify it correctly imports all chair data
- Test the page to ensure all chairs display properly

### Step 2: Verify Individual Chair Pages
- Check each chair detail page to ensure it's using the current components
- Fix any import or reference issues
- Test each page to verify proper rendering and variant selection

## Phase 4: Remove Unwanted Files

### Step 1: Identify Files to Remove
- Use the inventory to identify files that are no longer needed
- Verify that none of the files are referenced elsewhere in the code

### Step 2: Remove Files
- Remove old or duplicate chair data files
- Remove unused chair page files
- Clean up any temporary files created during development

## Phase 5: Verification

### Step 1: Build Verification
- Run the build process to ensure no TypeScript errors
- Fix any issues that arise

### Step 2: Functionality Testing
- Test the director series overview page
- Test each individual chair page
- Verify variant selection works correctly
- Ensure consistent styling across all pages

### Step 3: Documentation Update
- Update documentation to reflect the current implementation
- Document any issues encountered and their solutions

## Phase 6: Finalization

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Clean up Director Series implementation"
```

### Step 2: Update Task Status
- Mark the cleanup task as completed
- Document any follow-up tasks that may be needed
