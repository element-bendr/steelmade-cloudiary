# BigBoss Gold Director Chair Implementation Check

This document verifies the implementation of the BigBoss Gold Director Chair page to ensure it's using our new centralized styling system rather than the old EnhancedProductDetailLayout.

## Current Implementation Analysis

The BigBoss Gold Director Chair page is located at:
`app/chairs/director-series/bigboss-gold-director-chair/page.tsx`

Looking at the current implementation:

```tsx
// Excerpt from bigboss-gold-director-chair/page.tsx
import { ProductDetailLayout } from '@/components/products';

// ...other imports and code...

return (
  <>
    <ProductDetailLayout
      product={{
        ...bigbossGoldDirectorChair,
        // Ensure required fields have fallbacks
        price: bigbossGoldDirectorChair.price || 'Price on request',
        imageUrl: bigbossGoldDirectorChair.imageUrl || '/images/chairs/placeholder.jpg',
      }}
      contactOptions={{
        onContactClick: () => setShowContactForm(true),
      }}
      renderCustomSection={renderCustomSection}
    />
    
    {/* Materials Modal - outside of ProductDetailLayout */}
    {/* ...modal implementation... */}
  </>
);
```

## Findings

- **Current Component Usage**: The page is using `ProductDetailLayout` from '@/components/products'
- **NOT Using**: There is no import or usage of `EnhancedProductDetailLayout`
- **Styling Approach**: The page follows our new centralized styling system
- **Custom Elements**: The page includes a custom section for luxury materials and a modal

## Consistency Check

To ensure consistency with the Opera Director Chair page:

1. **Component Usage**: Both pages use `ProductDetailLayout` ✓
2. **Layout Structure**: Both have the standard two-column layout ✓
3. **Custom Sections**: Both implement custom sections appropriate to their product ✓
4. **Price Display**: Opera chair removes price display, BigBoss Gold still shows price ✗

## Required Updates

1. **Remove Price Display**:
   - Update the BigBoss Gold page to set price to empty string: `price: '',`
   - This will match the Opera chair's approach of not showing prices

2. **Import Name Fix**:
   - Check if the import name should be `bigbossgoldDirectorChair` instead of `bigbossGoldDirectorChair`
   - Fix import statement to match the actual export name from the data file

## Conclusion

The BigBoss Gold Director Chair page is correctly using our new centralized styling system with `ProductDetailLayout`, but needs minor updates to match the Opera Director Chair page's styling completely.
