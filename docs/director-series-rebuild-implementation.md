# Director Series Rebuild Implementation

## Overview

The Director Series chairs have been completely rebuilt with a consistent styling approach, modular components, and a standardized factory pattern. This ensures a uniform user experience across all chair products and simplifies the addition of new chairs in the future.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Chair Factory Pattern

We've implemented a factory pattern for chair creation in `lib/factories/chairFactory.ts`. This provides:

- Standardized Chair and ChairVariant interfaces
- A reusable `createDirectorChair` factory function
- Automated Cloudinary URL generation
- Consistent data structure across all chairs

### 2. Standardized Components

We've created a set of reusable components:

- `ChairCard`: For displaying chairs in grid layouts with consistent styling
- `ChairDetail`: For displaying chair details with standardized layout
- `ChairPageLayout`: A wrapper layout for all chair detail pages

### 3. Consistent Chair Data

All chairs now use the same data structure:

- Consistent ID naming conventions
- Standardized variant handling
- Uniform feature list formatting
- Proper Cloudinary image URL structure

### 4. Implemented Chairs

We've implemented all six director series chairs:

1. **Ashley Director Chair**
2. **Opera Director Chair**
3. **Tycoon Director Chair**
4. **BigBoss Gold Director Chair**
5. **Woodland Director Chair**
6. **Boston Director Chair**

Each chair has:
- High-back and mid-back variants
- Consistent feature lists
- Standardized descriptions
- Uniform styling

### 5. Director Series Page

The Director Series page now displays all chairs with consistent:
- Grid layout
- Card styling
- Hover effects
- Image display

## Styling Standards

All chair pages now follow these styling standards:

- **Colors**: SteelMade red (#B91C1C) for accents and selected states
- **Typography**: Consistent font sizes and weights
- **Layout**: Two-column layout on desktop, single column on mobile
- **Components**: Uniform styling across all components
- **Visual Elements**: Decorative rectangle in image corners

## Adding New Chairs

To add a new chair to the Director Series:

1. Create a new chair data file using the factory pattern
2. Create a detail page using the standardized components
3. Add the chair to the director series page imports
4. No need to manually style components - all styling is handled by the shared components

## Benefits

This rebuild provides:

1. **Consistent UX**: All chairs have the same look and feel
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to styling only need to be made in one place
3. **Simpler Additions**: New chairs can be added with minimal code
4. **Better Performance**: Shared components reduce code duplication
5. **Enhanced Brand Identity**: Consistent use of SteelMade styling
