## Verification

All files were safely removed after:
1. Checking for imports referencing these files
2. Creating backups in the removed-duplicates-backup directory
3. Verifying the application still builds and runs correctly

## Next Steps

- Continue implementing consistent file naming standards (Task 28.4)
- Create import path guidelines to prevent future duplication (Task 28.5)
- Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors after removal
