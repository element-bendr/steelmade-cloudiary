## Session Updates: Structural Improvements and Bug Fixes

**Date:** 2023-11-15

### 1. Product URL Structure Standardization

We standardized product URL patterns to match a consistent format:
- Updated product IDs in mock data to follow the pattern `[product-name]-[product-type]`
- Example: Changed "ashley" to "ashley-director-chair"
- Ensures URLs like `/chairs/director-series/ashley-director-chair` work correctly
- Applied this pattern consistently across all products in the mock dataset

### 2. Error Handling and Debugging Improvements

Enhanced error tracking and visibility for better troubleshooting:
- Added detailed console error logging in the `getProductById` function
- Implemented logging of available product IDs when a product is not found
- Added error logging in page components to track missing products
- Added explicit 404 handling with descriptive messages

### 3. Dynamic Routes Implementation

Created and fixed dynamic route pages for product detail views:
- Implemented `/[productType]/[seriesId]/[productId]/page.tsx` route
- Fixed "File is not a module" error by ensuring proper exports
- Ensured type compatibility between components and data sources
- Added proper error boundaries for enhanced UX during errors

### 4. Type System Improvements

Created a more robust type system for product data:
- Defined interfaces for `ProductImage`, `ProductVariant`, `ExtendedProductData`, and `ProductSeries`
- Made optional fields explicitly marked (e.g., `images?: ProductImage[]`)
- Ensured type consistency across components and data
- Created type-safe utility functions for data retrieval

### 5. UI Enhancements

Improved visual presentation across product pages:
- Added modern, glassmorphism effects to feature lists
- Replaced bullet points with numbered indicators for features
- Implemented responsive grid layouts for better mobile experience
- Fixed image display issues with proper containment
- Added proper image sizing attributes for performance optimization

### 6. Image Optimization

Improved image loading performance:
- Added `sizes` attribute to all `Image` components using `fill` property
- Implemented proper object-fit strategies (`object-contain` vs `object-cover`)
- Added padding to prevent images from touching container edges
- Optimized responsive image loading based on viewport size
- Created consistent styling for product images across the application

### 7. Data Architecture Improvements

Implemented a modular approach to product data:
- Organized mock data by category → series → product structure
- Created utility functions for efficient data retrieval
- Added helper functions with proper error handling
- Designed for future expansion with minimal code changes
- Prepared structure for eventual backend/CMS integration

These improvements have enhanced the application's robustness, performance, and maintainability while providing a more consistent user experience.
