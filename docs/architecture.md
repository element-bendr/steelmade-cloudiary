## Session Updates: Structural Improvements and Bug Fixes

**Date:** 2023-11-15

### 1. Product URL Structure Standardization

We standardized product URL patterns to match a consistent format:
- Updated product IDs in mock data to follow the pattern `[product-name]-[product-type]`
- Example: Changed "ashley" to "ashley-director-chair"
- Ensures URLs like `/chairs/director-series/ashley-director-chair` work correctly
- Applied this pattern consistently across all products in the mock dataset

### 2. Error Handling and Debugging Improvements

Enhanced error tracking and visibility for better troubleshooting:
- Added detailed console error logging in the `getProductById` function
- Implemented logging of available product IDs when a product is not found
- Added error logging in page components to track missing products
- Added explicit 404 handling with descriptive messages

### 3. Dynamic Routes Implementation

Created and fixed dynamic route pages for product detail views:
- Implemented `/[productType]/[seriesId]/[productId]/page.tsx` route
- Fixed "File is not a module" error by ensuring proper exports
- Ensured type compatibility between components and data sources
- Added proper error boundaries for enhanced UX during errors

### 4. Type System Improvements

Created a more robust type system for product data:
- Defined interfaces for `ProductImage`, `ProductVariant`, `ExtendedProductData`, and `ProductSeries`
- Made optional fields explicitly marked (e.g., `images?: ProductImage[]`)
- Ensured type consistency across components and data
- Created type-safe utility functions for data retrieval

### 5. UI Enhancements

Improved visual presentation across product pages:
- Added modern, glassmorphism effects to feature lists
- Replaced bullet points with numbered indicators for features
- Implemented responsive grid layouts for better mobile experience
- Fixed image display issues with proper containment
- Added proper image sizing attributes for performance optimization

### 6. Image Optimization

Improved image loading performance:
- Added `sizes` attribute to all `Image` components using `fill` property
- Implemented proper object-fit strategies (`object-contain` vs `object-cover`)
- Added padding to prevent images from touching container edges
- Optimized responsive image loading based on viewport size
- Created consistent styling for product images across the application

### 7. Data Architecture Improvements

Implemented a modular approach to product data:
- Organized mock data by category → series → product structure
- Created utility functions for efficient data retrieval
- Added helper functions with proper error handling
- Designed for future expansion with minimal code changes
- Prepared structure for eventual backend/CMS integration

These improvements have enhanced the application's robustness, performance, and maintainability while providing a more consistent user experience.

## Type System Standardization and Consistency Improvements

**Date:** 2023-11-17

### 1. Unified Product Category Type System

We standardized the product category type system to eliminate inconsistencies:
- Created `types/product-categories.ts` as the central module for category-related types
- Established `ProductCategorySlug` for URL-friendly identifiers (e.g., "chairs", "tables")
- Added `ProductCategoryName` for user-friendly display names (e.g., "Chairs", "Tables")
- Implemented helper functions for conversion between formats
- Added type guards for runtime validation (`isValidCategorySlug`, `isValidCategoryName`)
- Fixed type mismatches across API functions and components

### 2. Standardized Variant Type System

We improved the product variant system to handle different variant formats:
- Created `types/variants.ts` with a standardized `Variant` interface
- Added adapter functions for backward compatibility with legacy variant formats
- Implemented type guards for runtime validation (`isLegacyVariant`, `isVariant`)
- Fixed inconsistencies in property naming (id/variantId, name/variantName)
- Ensured components can handle both formats with appropriate type checking

### 3. API Layer Enhancements

We enhanced the API layer to use the standardized types:
- Updated `collections.ts` and `products.ts` to use `ProductCategorySlug`
- Added validation to ensure only valid categories are processed
- Improved error handling and debug logging for invalid categories
- Made API routes consistent with the type system
- Fixed type mismatches between client components and API functions

### 4. Component Updates

We updated key components to use the standardized types:
- Fixed `CollectionDetail` component to use `ProductCategorySlug`
- Updated `ContactButtonWithVariant` to handle both variant formats
- Enhanced `CollectionCarousel` to work with the standardized types
- Added proper type checking throughout component chain
- Created unified product card components with type-safe props

### 5. Hook Improvements

We optimized custom hooks for type safety and performance:
- Updated `useProducts` hook to use the standardized `ProductCategorySlug` type
- Enhanced `useCarouselDrag` with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Fixed issues with event handling in drag functionality
- Implemented `useCallback` for performance optimization
- Added proper cleanup in `useEffect` dependencies

### 6. Documentation and Guidelines

We added comprehensive documentation for the type system:
- Created `docs/type-system.md` with usage examples and patterns
- Added migration guidelines for updating components
- Documented type guards and helper functions
- Provided examples of converting between formats
- Established conventions for future type definitions

### 7. Comprehensive Product Category Type System

We expanded our product category type system to support all specialized furniture categories:
- Added additional categories to ProductCategorySlug: 'hospital-furniture', 'racking-systems', 'school-furniture', 'storage-solutions', and 'modular-furniture'
- Updated display names in ProductCategoryName with corresponding entries
- Maintained a consistent naming convention for slugs using hyphenated format
- Resolved a naming conflict between 'storage' and 'storage-solutions' by using 'Storage Solutions II' as display name
- Updated CATEGORY_DISPLAY_NAMES and CATEGORY_SLUGS mappings for all new categories
- Extended CollectionNav component to include all categories in the navigation
- Fixed type errors in specialized route files like hospital-furniture, racking-systems, etc.
- Ensured API functions correctly validate all supported category slugs

This comprehensive type system now provides full coverage for all furniture categories used throughout the application, eliminating type errors and creating a scalable foundation for future category additions.

These improvements have significantly enhanced the application's type safety, maintainability, and developer experience by providing a consistent, well-documented type system throughout the codebase.
