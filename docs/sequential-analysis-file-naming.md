# Sequential Analysis of File Naming Issues

## Step 1: Understanding the file-naming-issues.md Report
- The file-naming-issues.md was generated by the lint-file-names.js script
- It contains issues where files don't follow our established naming conventions
- We need to analyze the types of issues found and create a remediation plan

## Step 2: Common Issue Patterns
Let's categorize the types of issues that are likely in the report:
1. Temporary file indicators (-new, .bak, -fixed, etc.)
2. Version numbers in filenames (-v1, -version2, etc.)
3. Inconsistent casing (mixed camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case)
4. Files in incorrect locations based on their purpose
5. General naming pattern violations

## Step 3: Prioritization Approach
We should prioritize fixes in the following order:
1. Critical files that are actively causing import issues
2. Files in frequently accessed directories
3. Temporary/duplicate files that should be consolidated
4. General naming convention issues

## Step 4: Remediation Process
For each file with naming issues:
1. Determine the correct name based on our standards
2. Check if the file is imported anywhere (using find-imports.js)
3. Create a git branch for the renaming
4. Rename the file and update all imports
5. Test to ensure functionality is preserved
6. Commit changes with descriptive message

## Step 5: Documentation Updates
After fixing the issues:
1. Update the removed-files-log.md if any files were consolidated
2. Record the renamed files in a new document
3. Run the lint-file-names.js script again to verify issues are resolved

## Step 6: Implementation Plan
We'll create a specific plan once we've reviewed the actual report contents
