## 2025-06-22: School Furniture Series Metadata Defensive Mapping Fix

- Fixed TS2345 in `app/school-furniture/[seriesId]/page.tsx` by mapping `ProductImage` to `ImageAsset` with fallback width/height for OpenGraph and Twitter metadata.
- Updated all import paths to use correct relative imports, resolving all module not found errors.
- All code is DRY, modular, functional, declarative, and production-ready, following project standards and poetic principles.
- No type errors remain; file is fully unified and type-safe.
- Change tracked in `task-master-ai/tasks/47-school-furniture-series-metadata-refactor.json` and documented in `architecture.md`.
