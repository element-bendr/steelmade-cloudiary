## 2025-06-22: Canonical Product/Series Types Refactor & Error Fixes

- Refactored all product and series data/pages for racking systems, school furniture, and storage solutions to use canonical types from `lib/data/product-types.ts`.
- Removed all legacy/duplicate types and updated all usages to canonical types (`ExtendedProductData`, `ProductSeries`, `ProductImage`, `ProductType`).
- Fixed all type/module errors in product, series, and collection grid components by updating imports and using local type definitions where needed.
- All `.map` parameters are now explicitly typed for type safety.
- All import paths are now relative and correct; no more module not found errors.
- All code is DRY, modular, functional, declarative, and production-ready, following project standards and poetic principles.
- All changes tracked in `task-master-ai/tasks/42-canonical-types-refactor.json` and related task files.
