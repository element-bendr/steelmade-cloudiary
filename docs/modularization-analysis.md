# Project Modularization Analysis

## 1. Component Mapping and Interactions

### Core Components
- **ProductDetailPage**
  - Primary display component for product information
  - Dependencies: ProductGallery, VariantSelector, ContactButtonWithVariant
  - State: Manages product loading and variant selection

- **ProductGallery**
  - Handles product image display and navigation
  - Dependencies: Cloudinary image optimization
  - State: Manages active image and zoom state

- **VariantSelector**
  - Controls product variant selection
  - Dependencies: Product data types
  - State: Manages selected variant and validation

### Data Flow Patterns
- Product data flows from API/mock data → page components → child components
- Variant selection state flows upward from VariantSelector to parent components
- Image optimization logic spans across multiple display components

## 2. Tightly Coupled Areas

### Product Data Management
- Product fetching tightly coupled with page components
- Direct dependencies between data types and UI components
- Manual prop drilling for variant state management

### Image Handling
- Cloudinary configuration spread across components
- Duplicate image optimization logic
- Tight coupling between gallery and image components

### Component Dependencies
- Navigation relies heavily on category/series structure
- Contact forms tightly coupled with variant selection
- Product cards dependent on specific data shapes

## 3. Logical Feature Groups

### Product Management Module
- Product data fetching and caching
- Category and series organization
- Variant management system
- Type definitions and validation

### Image Processing Module
- Cloudinary integration layer
- Image optimization utilities
- Gallery component system
- Thumbnail management

### UI Component Library
- Navigation components
- Product display cards
- Collection grid/carousel
- Form components

### State Management Layer
- Product selection handling
- Variant state management
- Cart/inquiry system
- Navigation state control

## 4. Initial Modularization Priorities

1. **Product Module**
   - Highest impact on maintainability
   - Clear boundaries possible
   - Critical for future features
   - Current pain point in development

2. **Image Module**
   - Well-defined responsibility
   - Reusable across features
   - Performance critical
   - Clear integration points

3. **UI Component Module**
   - Common design patterns
   - Reusable elements
   - Clear styling needs
   - Consistent behavior requirements

## Next Steps

1. Create initial module structure for Product Module
2. Define clear public APIs for each module
3. Implement proper type validation at boundaries
4. Add comprehensive test coverage
5. Document module interfaces and usage patterns
