# Woodland Director Chair Styling Standardization

## Issue Analysis

The Woodland Director Chair page currently has styling inconsistencies compared to other director series chairs. While we've implemented the basic structure and data correctly, there are several styling elements that need to be standardized:

1. **Variant Selection:**
   - The variant selection buttons may not be using the exact same styling as other chair pages
   - The hover and focus states might be inconsistent
   - The selected state highlighting could be different

2. **Image Container:**
   - The decorative rectangle in the corner might have different opacity or positioning
   - The image container border and shadow properties might vary
   - The responsive behavior could be inconsistent

3. **Feature List:**
   - The grid layout might not match the established pattern
   - The icon styling could be different
   - The spacing and typography might not be consistent

4. **Contact Button:**
   - The button styling might not use the consistent brand colors
   - The hover and active states could be different
   - The responsive behavior might not match other pages

## Standardization Plan

To ensure consistent styling across all director series chairs, including the Woodland model:

1. **Extract Common Styling:**
   - Create a dedicated CSS module or Tailwind component for chair page styling
   - Define standard styles for all shared elements
   - Implement consistent class usage across all chair pages

2. **Implement Component Reuse:**
   - Create reusable components for variant selection, feature lists, etc.
   - Ensure all chair pages use these shared components
   - Implement proper prop handling for customization while maintaining consistent styling

3. **Establish Style Guide:**
   - Document all styling patterns for chair pages
   - Create visual references for developers
   - Implement automated testing for style consistency

## Implementation Approach

The styling standardization should follow the modular approach used in other parts of the application:

1. Compare the Woodland chair page with established models like Ashley and Opera
2. Identify specific styling differences
3. Update the Woodland chair page to match the standard styling
4. Create reusable components where appropriate
5. Document the standardized approach for future chair additions

This standardization effort will ensure a consistent user experience across all director series chairs while maintaining the brand identity established in the project.
