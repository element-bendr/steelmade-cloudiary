# File Consolidation Checklist

Use this checklist when consolidating or removing duplicate files from the project.

## Pre-Removal Assessment

- [ ] Identify all duplicate/temporary files needing consolidation
- [ ] Determine the canonical (main) version of each file
- [ ] Compare files to identify unique features or enhancements
- [ ] Check for imports of the files in other project files
- [ ] Verify there are no runtime dependencies on the duplicate files

## Enhancement Process

- [ ] Create a backup branch before making changes
- [ ] Enhance the canonical file with necessary features from duplicates
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility for existing imports
- [ ] Add proper documentation to the canonical file
- [ ] Test the enhanced canonical file thoroughly

## Import Updates

- [ ] Identify all files importing the duplicates
- [ ] Update imports to reference the canonical file
- [ ] Test all affected components after import changes
- [ ] Verify that no imports remain for the duplicate files

## File Removal

- [ ] Mark duplicate files as deprecated with comment headers
- [ ] Remove the duplicate files one by one
- [ ] Test the application after each removal
- [ ] Document the removal in the appropriate docs

## Verification

- [ ] Run the full test suite
- [ ] Build the application
- [ ] Verify all pages and features still work
- [ ] Check for any console errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify there are no TypeScript or linting errors

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update technical documentation to reflect changes
- [ ] Record the consolidation in a change log
- [ ] Update import examples in developer documentation
- [ ] Add any new best practices identified during the process

## Knowledge Sharing

- [ ] Share file consolidation lessons with the team
- [ ] Update coding standards to prevent future duplication
- [ ] Review similar areas of the codebase for other duplicates
- [ ] Implement linting rules to catch future duplicates

## Post-Removal Cleanup

- [ ] Remove any backup files created during the process
- [ ] Clean up any commented-out code
- [ ] Update any references in task tracking
- [ ] Close related issues or tasks
