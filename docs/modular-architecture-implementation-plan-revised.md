# Modular Architecture Implementation Plan Revision

## Current Implementation Status

The initial modular architecture implementation has encountered several challenges:

1. Module resolution errors
2. React context compatibility issues
3. Server/client component confusion
4. Data processing errors

## Revised Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Stabilize Current Application (Immediate)
- Implement workarounds for critical errors (custom state management, safe data processing)
- Add proper error boundaries to prevent cascading failures
- Document known issues and temporary solutions

### Phase 2: Module Isolation (1-2 weeks)
- Fully isolate one module at a time, ensuring it has no dependencies on incomplete modules
- Implement proper barrel files with clear exports
- Create adapter layer to bridge old and new architecture

### Phase 3: Server/Client Component Separation (2-3 weeks)
- Clearly designate components as server or client
- Create boundary components where necessary
- Implement data fetching at server component level
- Pass data as props to client components

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Ongoing)
- Implement comprehensive testing for each module
- Create integration tests for module boundaries
- Test server/client component interaction
- Validate proper functioning in all environments

## Module Dependencies Map

To avoid circular dependencies and ensure proper implementation order:

1. **Core Types Module** (no dependencies)
   - Shared types and interfaces
   - Validation schemas (Zod)
   
2. **Utility Module** (depends on Core Types)
   - Helper functions
   - State management utilities
   
3. **Image Module** (depends on Core Types, Utility)
   - Image processing
   - Cloudinary integration
   
4. **Product Module** (depends on Core Types, Utility, Image)
   - Product data and services
   - Variant handling
   
5. **UI Components Module** (depends on Core Types, Utility)
   - Shared UI components
   - Design system elements

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Module Structure**
   - Every module should have an index.ts barrel file
   - Clear separation of types, services, and components
   - Explicit public API surface

2. **Server/Client Components**
   - Add 'use client' directive to all client components
   - Keep data fetching in server components
   - Use props for data passing when possible
   - Implement client-side state management where necessary

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add defensive programming for all data access
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Provide fallback UI for error states

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for each module function
   - Integration tests for module boundaries
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

By following this revised approach, we can achieve the benefits of modular architecture while avoiding the integration issues we've encountered so far.
