## 2025-06-28: Director Series Canonical Refactor

- Refactored all Director Series chair data and UI to use the canonical `directorSeries.products` object.
- Removed all legacy/duplicate files and the runtime registry (`registerDirectorChair`).
- Updated listing and detail pages to use the canonical object for all lookups and rendering.
- All code is DRY, modular, declarative, and production-ready, following project standards and poetic principles.
- Documentation and onboarding updated to reference only the canonical pattern.
- Change tracked in `task-master-ai.json` and summarized in `architecture/` docs.
